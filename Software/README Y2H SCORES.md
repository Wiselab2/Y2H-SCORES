# Instructions to run Y2H-SCORES

This repository contains the software Y2H-SCORES published in  Velásquez-Zapata *et.al.* (2020) Y2H-SCORES: A statistical framework to infer protein-protein interactions from next-generation yeast-two-hybrid sequencing data.   

**Overview**

This manual describes how to operate Y2H-SCORES to prioritize candidate protein-protein interactors reported by NGPINT (Banerjee et. al., 2020). Y2H-SCORES takes the output files from NGPINT (salmon counts and fusion counts) and computes three scores to rank protein-protein interactor candidates in a Y2H Next Generation Interaction Screening (NGIS) experiment.  

Y2H-SCORES is an aggregate of three experimental outcomes: 1) the enrichment score measures the non-selected population as a baseline to detect which preys are significantly enriched under selection, 2) the specificity score uses selected samples as a control baseline to measure the specificity of a prey, and 3) the *in-frame* score makes use of the fusion read information to identify *in-frame* enrichment of the prey fragments under selection. 

Y2H-SCORES has been submitted for peer review, but the preprint can be accessed from https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.08.288365. Please refer to the manuscript for more details about each module. The entire pipeline has been coded in R.

**Downloading Y2H-SCORES**

For Linux/Mac operating systems, in the terminal: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Wiselab2/Y2H-SCORES/Software 
```
In Windows download the folder from https://github.com/Wiselab2/Y2H-SCORES/Software.

**Running Y2H-SCORES**

Y2H-SCORES is coupled with the software NGPINT so it is designed to work with the outputs from this program. To run Y2H-SCORES, use the run\_scores.R, a script that process the input count tables and generate the three scores. It requires the following files:

1. Text file with the full paths to the configuration files that contain the input arguments used to run NGPINT. This file should be indicated with the argument --fofn.

2. Outputs from the pipeline NGPINT. Y2H-SCORES uses the BaitName\_final\_report.csv and BaitName\_salmon\_count.matrix files. These files should be in the path as indicated in the output\_directory from the configuration files. These files contain the total counts and the fusion counts that will be used to calculate the Y2H-SCORES.

3. Configuration files from the NGPINT software.  They should contain all the paths to the input files and the sample names.

4. If baits should be grouped to calculate the specificity score, one text file with baits in each group, separated by comma.  Indicated with the argument --spec_groups. If no file is provided, the baits will be grouped randomly.

  To run Y2H-SCORES in Linux/Mac use the terminal and in Windows the Anaconda Prompt: 

```
cd Y2H-SCORES/Software
Rscript run_scores.R --fofn --out_dir --spec_groups --spec_p_val --spec_fold_change --enrich_p_val --enrich_fold_change --normalized 
```

With the arguments:

```
--fofn: text file with the full paths to the configuration files

--out_dir: full path to the output directory to save the calculations from the Y2H-SCORES.  
          This should be different from the output\_directory in the configuration files.
          
--spec_groups: text file with baits to be analyzed together to calculate the specificity score. Default NULL 
			   Each line should contain each group, separating baits by comma. 
			   If no file is provided, the baits will be grouped randomly.

--spec_p_val: threshold for the p-values that are used to calculate the specificity score.
              Values between [0,1]. Default value of 1. Smaller values indicate more stringent scores.

--spec_fold_change: threshold for the fold-changes that are used to calculate the specificity score.  
                    This should be larger or equal to zero. Default of zero. 
                    Larger values indicate more stringent scores.

-enrich_p_val: the desired threshold for the p-values that are used to calculate the enrichment score.  
               Values between [0,1]. Default value of 1. Smaller values indicate more stringent scores.
               
--enrich_fold_change: threshold for the fold-changes that are used to calculate the enrichment score.  
                      This should be larger or equal to zero. Default of zero. 
                      Larger values indicate more stringent scores.
                    
--normalized: Boolean value (T or F) indicating if the counts are normalized. 
			  Default false (F), then the program will implement library size normalizaiton
```

**Output**

After running Y2H-SCORES there should be an output directory named as indicated with the --out\_dir argument. This folder should have a file called Total\_scores.csv with the compilation of the three scores for every prey/bait combination.  The table should have the following columns: prey, bait, Enrichment score, Specificity score, *In-frame* score, *In-frame* prey transcripts (list of prey transcripts that have the maximum *in-frame* score for each prey), Sum scores and Borda score.

To prioritize interactors use the ensemble scores given by the Borda score column. Alternatively, each of the three scores and their sum can be used as a guide. Higher values indicate more likely interactors. 

# Toy example
 The *toy\_example* directory contain a minimum dataset that is required to run Y2H-SCORES. 

**File description**

 This repository should contain the following files:

* bait1\_input\_arguments.csv, bait2\_input\_arguments.csv: minimum configuration files to run Y2H-SCORES. You can use the same configuration files as the ones used to run the NGPINT pipeline, keeping the same file structure. The full paths to the input files and the sample names that are written in this file are used to run Y2H-SCORES.

* Two folders called bait1 and bait2 with the corresponding bait#\_final\_report.csv and bait#\_salmon\_counts.mat obtained as outputs from the NGPINT pipeline. These files are inputs to calculate the Y2H-SCORES.

* Text file with the full paths to the configuration files that contain the input arguments that were used to run NGPINT. This file should be indicated with the argument -fofn. For this example the corresponding file was called fofn\_for\_compute\_scores.txt. This file provides the path information to *compute\_scores_newInt.py* so it can read the configuration files.

  **Running Y2H-SCORES with the toy example dataset**

To run Y2H-SCORES with the toy dataset in Linux/Mac use the terminal and in Windows the Anaconda Prompt :

```
cd Y2H-SCORES/Software
Rscript run_scores_args_groups_se.R --fofn "toy_dataset/fofn_for_compute_scores.txt" --out_dir "output_toy_dataset/" --spec_p_val 0.5 --spec_fold_change 2 --enrich_p_val 0.5 --enrich_fold_change 0 --normalized F
```
In this example we are running the Y2H-SCORES with the arguments:

```
--fofn toy_dataset/fofn_for_compute_scores.txt contains the text file with the full paths to the configuration files 
  bait1\_input\_arguments.csv and bait2\_input\_arguments.csv.

--out_dir output_toy_dataset/ corresponds to the name of the folder that will be generated to save the outputs from Y2H-SCORES. The software will create this folder, it is not necessary to make it beforehand.

--spec_p_val 0.5 is the desired threshold for the p-values that are used to calculate the specificity score. 

--spec_fold_change 2 the desired threshold for the fold-changes that are used to calculate the specificity score. Larger values indicate more stringent scores.

--enrich_p_val 0.5 the desired threshold for the p-values that are used to calculate the enrichment score.  
  Smaller values indicate more stringent scores.
  
--enrich_fold_change 0 the desired threshold for the fold-changes that are used to calculate the enrichment score. Larger values indicate more stringent scores.

--normalized F This ask the program to normalize the raw counts using library size method.
  
```
After running the Y2H-SCORES software there will be a new folder in *toy\_example*  called *output\_toy_dataset*. This folder contains the *Total\_scores.csv* file with the compilation of the three scores and the columns: prey, bait, Enrichment score, Specificity score, *In-frame* score, In-frame prey transcripts, Sum of scores and Borda scores.
