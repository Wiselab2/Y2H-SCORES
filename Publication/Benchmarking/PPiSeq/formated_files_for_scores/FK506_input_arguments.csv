genome,Specify the name of the genome fasta file of the organism. Please note that the program will not be able to handle multiple fasta files. If you have multiple fasta files please concatenate them and put them in one file,1,,/work/LAS/rpwise-lab/sagnik/data/arath/genome/Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa
star_genome_index,Specify the directory where the STAR index of the genome is present. Please check the manual to see directions about how to generate STAR index. Please note that STAR takes a pretty long time to generate indices.,0,None,
output_directory,Specify an output directory to which all the generated files will be housed. This includes the progress.log file which can be later checked. Please make sure that there are sufficient permissions to create the output directory. The program will throw an error if creation of the output directory fails. This directory will contain the summary file containing the details of the execution,1,None,PPiSeq/formated_files_for_scores/FK506

nucleotide_for_frame_shift,Enter the nucleotide with which 3 frame generation has been done,0,None,
min_trimmed_length,Please provide the minimum length of the sequence to keep post adapter trimming,1,15,
force,Overwrites the output directory if it exists. Setting this flag will enforce the software to run all the steps.,1,0,
clean_up,Set this to 1 if you wish to clean up all the intermediate files. The program will keep all temporary files by default.,0,0,
