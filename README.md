# Software and supporting code for Y2H-SCORES

This repository contains the software Y2H-SCORES and supporting code for the publication Velásquez-Zapata *et.al.* (2021) Next-generation yeast-two-hybrid analysis with Y2H-SCORES identifies novel interactors of the MLA immune receptor.   

**Overview**

The structure of this repository consists of two directories. In the software directory all the functions and instructions to operate Y2H-SCORES can be found. The Publication directory contains all the supporting code for the publication, including the Y2H-NGIS simulator and the benchmarking of the method with several datasets.

Y2H-SCORES has been published in PLoS Computational Biology, it can be accessed from https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008890. Please refer to the paper for more details about each module. The entire pipeline has been coded in R.
