# Software and supporting code for Y2H-SCORES

This repository contains the software Y2H-SCORES and supporting code for the publication Velásquez-Zapata *et.al.* (2020) Y2H-SCORES: A statistical framework to infer protein-protein interactions from next-generation yeast-two-hybrid sequencing data.   

**Overview**

The structure of this repository consists of two directories. In the software directory all the functions and instructions to operate Y2H-SCORES can be found. The Publication directory contains all the supporting code for the publication, including the Y2H-NGIS simulator and the benchmarking of the method with several datasets.

Y2H-SCORES has been submitted for peer review, but the preprint can be accessed from https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.08.288365. Please refer to the manuscript for more details about each module. The entire pipeline has been coded in R.
